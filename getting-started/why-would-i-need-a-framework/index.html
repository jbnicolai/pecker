                <h4 id="wrangle-a-variety-of-assets-with-complex-dependencies-easily">Wrangle a variety of assets with complex dependencies easily</h4>

<p>A web project typically may start with something as simple as the following set of assets:</p>

<ul>
<li>One HTML file</li>
<li>One stylesheet (.css) file</li>
<li>Maybe a couple of images</li>
</ul>

<p>At this stage of development, it may seems trivial managing your assets.
But as your project gets bigger and complex, you might find yourself trying to juggle a huge number of assets.</p>

<p>Things might start to feel that its getting out of hand but with a little elbow grease, you probably might be able to devise the most ingenious folder structure.</p>

<p>But how about when those assets start to have complex dependencies among itselves? </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a typical scenario for a medium-sized project:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your client-side JavaScript application file requires a <strong>custom vendor</strong> code, that depends on multiple <strong>Bower</strong>-managed component, along with several <strong>external scripts</strong> hosted on different <strong>CDN networks</strong>. Let&#39;s not get started on <strong>stylesheets and images</strong> that needed to be included.
Oh, have we mentioned that the <strong>dependency order</strong> mattered too. Also, let&#39;s not forget about having to need to refer to the URL path to your <strong>HTML templates</strong>  within your application on the client-side.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Phew.</p>

<p>We both know that this could easily happen to you.</p>

<p>Because it happened before.</p>

<p><strong>Pecker framework helps you keep your sanity levels in check with ways to organize your assets in a logical manner.</strong></p>

<hr>

<h4 id="pre--and-post-processing-transformation-to-assets">Pre- and post-processing transformation to assets</h4>

<p>There&#39;s a high chance that you are already dealing with an automated build workflow for your project using Grunt, Gulp or [insert latest and kewlest build tool here]. </p>

<p>A typical web development scenario would involve the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pre-process dynamic stylesheet files (LessCSS, SASS etc) into CSS stylesheets files.</li>
<li>Auto-prefix vendor-specific prefixes to CSS rules.</li>
<li>Optimize your CSS stylesheet for improved performance through minification.</li>
<li>Optimize your JavaScript files for improved performances through minification and name-mangling.</li>
<li>Bundling your Javascript files for use in browsers using Browserify</li>
<li>And much more!</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, there is no shortage of use-cases for processing your assets before serving them up in your web applications.</p>

<p><strong>Pecker framework provides various mechanisms to handle pre- and post-processing for different types of assets to fit your project.</strong></p>

<h4 id="overcoming-hurdles-with-browser-caching-and-versioning-issues">Overcoming hurdles with browser-caching and versioning issues</h4>

<p>Have you been in a similar situation where you make modifications to, for example a CSS stylesheet, for a web application you&#39;re developing, but no matter how many times you refresh the browser, the changes refuse to show up? </p>

<p>Out of desperation, you manually clear your browser cache and re-launch it. Well, after one too many times, you can see how frustrating it is and how it hinders your productivity.</p>

<p>Browser caching are godsend for visitors using your web application (faster response time and all that), but as a developer, you&#39;d probably had yourself convinced at one point of time that it was forged by the Devil himself just to make your application development a living hell.</p>

<p>Try googling <a href="https://www.google.com.sg/#q=cache+busting">cache busting</a>, and it will show you a plethora of ways to deal with aggressive browser cache.</p>

<p><strong>Pecker framework has built-in mechanisms for cache-busting with added advantage of versioning 
your assets as well.</strong></p>

<h4 id="bridging-a-gap-between-server-and-client-side-code,-making-assets-available-on-both-ends">Bridging a gap between server and client-side code, making assets available on both ends</h4>

<p>A simple scenario for this would be HTML templates for your web application. Sometimes you find yourself needing to refer to a template file on both the front-end and the back-end code. Well, what&#39;s the problem?</p>

<p>The issue here is that depending on where you are and what you need, you might be looking for either </p>

<ul>
<li>the <strong>file path</strong> to the asset on the server&#39;s file system, for eg: <code>/opt/apps/server/static/templates/view.hbs</code></li>
<li>the <strong>URL path</strong> of the asset relative to the base root URL, for eg: <code>/assets/templates/view.hbs</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pecker framework bridges the gap between server and client-side code by making available full-featured APIs for both side that you can use to work with your assets, not against it.</strong></p>
