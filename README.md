# PECKER
Pecker is a modern assets management framework for your web application development.

**Pecker is currently still under heavy development.**

**APIs may change / break before v.1.0.0 release**


*In the meantime, contributions are greatly welcomed*

## Features
* Assets watcher
* Mechanisms to pre- and post-processed assets
* Fine-grained control for triggering per-file builds
* Cache-buster
* Versioning through content-hashing
* Automatically resolve URL and absolute file path to latest version of asset
* Helpers to include assets (stylesheets, scripts) in views
* Full-featured APIs for both server-side and client-side scripts

## Work well with latest web technologies
* Browserify for your CommonJS modules. (AMD too, with [a little help](https://github.com/jaredhanson/deamdify))
* NPM and Bower; modern package managers for both your server and client-side code respectively.
* Pick and choose your build tools: Grunt, Gulp, even Broccoli. Let Pecker handle assets management and be part of your build workflow.

## Quickstart
The easiest and quickest way to start using Pecker is through the CLI by installing it as a global module

```
npm install pecker -g 	// install globally for CLI
cd path/to/your/project	// navigate to your project
pecker init 			// initialize configuration file
pecker					// run build
```

### Congratulations! You have just configured your project and build your assets!
Continue reading the documentation to explore more ways to leverage Pecker in your web application development.

-----
## Installation
You can choose to install Pecker using ```npm``` as either a global or local NodeJS module, or both!

To install it globally

```
npm install pecker -g
```

To install it locally within your project directory:

```
cd /path/to/your/project
npm install pecker

```

## Usages
Besides using the Pecker CLI program, there are many ways to use Pecker for your project.

* as a CLI program
* as a local NodeJS module
* as a Gulp task for your build workflow
* as a client-side script

### Using Pecker as a command-line program
* need to install as a global module
* can run Pecker CLI as ```pecker```

### Using Pecker as a local module

Simply install Pecker module and require it in your NodeJS script.

Here's an example on how to use ```Pecker.Builder``` directly

```
var Pecker = require('pecker');

// define Pecker.Builder options
var opts = { /*...*/ };
// or require an external .js or .json file containing configured options
// for eg: var opts = require('./pecker.json');

// create Pecker.Builder instance
var builder = new Pecker.Builder(opts);

// run build
builder.buildAssets(function () {
	console.log('Build completed');
);

```
Refer to API documentation to explore more in depth.

### Using Pecker as a Gulp task
Using Pecker in your Gulp build workflow is as simple as using the Pecker module directly in your ```gulpfile.js``` and defining a gulp task.

```
// gulpfile.js

var gulp = require('gulp');
var Pecker = require('pecker');

// define gulp task using Pecker.Builder
gulp.task('build', function (done) {

	// define Pecker.Builder options
	var opts = { /*...*/ };
	// or require an external .js or .json file containing configured options
	// for eg: var opts = require('./pecker.json');

	// create Pecker.Builder instance
	var builder = new Pecker.Builder(opts);

	// build assets defined in `opts`
	builder.buildAssets(function () {
		console.log('Build completed');
		done();
	}); 
);
```

Refer to API documentation to explore more in depth.

### Using Pecker as client-side script in browser
When you run Pecker.Builder.buildAssets(), the following assets will be build automatically as well:

```
// manifest.json
{
	...
    Pecker": {
      "type": "package",
      "names": [
        "pecker.js",
        "pecker-loader.js"
      ]
    },
    "pecker.js": {
      "type": "browserify",
      "url": "<url_to_pecker.js>",
      "path": "<path_to_pecker.js>"
    },
    "pecker-loader.js": {
      "type": "file",
      "url": "<url_to_pecker-loader.js>",
      "path": "<path_to_pecker-loader.js>"
    }
}

```
* ```Pecker``` package asset 
* ```pecker.js``` file asset
* ```pecker-loader.js``` file asset

To load Pecker as a client-side script in browser, use the Pecker.Assets.constructAssetHTML() include Pecker script and its loader.

```

var fs = require('fs');
var Pecker = require('pecker');

// load generated manifest.json after building assets
var manifest = fs.readFileSync('.,/path/to/manifest.json');

var peckerAssets = new Pecker.Assets(manifest);
var scriptsHTML = peckerAssets.constructAssetHTML('Pecker');
// for eg:
// <script src="dist/pecker.34441db2759b83d7a0dba5eb2cef468e.js"></script>
// <script src="dist/pecker-loader.2b9d844c90c9fc3b4f2dcc4bdedd4714.js"></script>
// add `scriptsHTML` into your view / template
```

Refer to API documentation to explore more in depth.

## Tests
To run tests

```
git clone https://github.com/sogko/pecker.git
cd pecker
npm install
npm test
```

## Known Issues
### `node-sass` transform fails if file contains `@import` directives
Since the transform works on buffered content of files, ```node-sass``` needs to know of the path(s) of the imported files.
Solution: simply specify the ``includePaths``` option to ```node-sass```.

Example:

```
// your-pecker-config-file.js
var options = module.exports = {
  ...
  assets: [
    {
      type: 'file',
      name: 'style.css',
      files: [ './src/css/style.css' ],
      transform: [
        {
          fn: 'node-sass',
          args: {
            includePaths: [
            '/absolute/path/to/src/css/',
            './relative/path/to/baseDir/'
            ]            
          }
        }
      ]
    },
}
```

## TODO
* Pecker config
    * would it be useful to have a `description` field for each asset?
    * ~~`skipHash`~~
    * Change default to always skipHash: true? Not sure which is better.    
    * each asset may have a different destDir and url?
    * build dependencies: allow an asset to be build after building anotherr asset
    	* use-case: compile .scss files, compile .less files, concat and minify both
* Additional asset types
	* images (? should we simply stick with having a generic `file` type)
	    * we can do image resize or generate different dimensions from a single source image
	* textual content (?)
	* internationalization / localization (?)
	* a `bower` type?
	    * its an extension to `folder` and `package` type
	    * only copy files defined in `bower.json -> asset -> main`
	    * `main` can be overidden
	    * when asset name is referenced in a package, expand to its main
	* does it make sense to extend this to `npm`?
	    * if you want to include npm module, can use browserify.
	    * and usually npm modules that can work in browser, would have a bower registry entry anyway
	* how about `component`?
	* support `duo` (similar fashion to `browserify`)
* Pecker CLI
    * ~~default to `help`~~
    * Add new actions
        * `clean`
        * `prune`
        * ~~`add`~~
        * `remove`
    * ~~`destDir` is relative to `baseDir`~~
* Pecker.Builder
    * watchAssets(): use default if opt.watch is not defined
    * watchAssets to emit events or accept event hooks
* Pecker.Assets
    * How to expose asset data to SASS files? (These are non-JavaScript)
    	* For other .scss files, @import as usual, use `includePaths` to let `sass` find it .
    	* For urls (fonts/images), currently we can hardcode it. but find a solution to get the right url?
    * Client-side: Make Pecker available in `window`, and maybe through angular
    * In-line assets
	* Create an inline content for existing asset.
	* For eg: inlined images, inlined scripts, inlined stylesheets
	* Why would you want to inline? Reduce number of HTTP requests
	* Pre-fetch assets using ```<link rel="prefetch" ... />``` supported in HTML5
* Built-in transforms
	* ~~image minifier (using gulp-imagemin)~~
	* sourcemaps (using gulp-sourcemaps)
	* ~~LESS-CSS~~
	* ~~pass in peckerOptions and assetOptions to built-in transform~~
	* ~~automatically resolve path-related arguments for built-in transforms~~
* Tutorials
    * Show an example of using Pecker.Assets and a static file server to always serve the latest version of an asset. (For eg: accessing ```/static/style.css``` will serve ```/static/style.9d29jd.css```)
    * Use Pecker.Assets in Jekyll
